1] A class is a C++ vehicle for translating an abstraction to a user-defined type. It combines
data representation and methods for manipulating that data into one neat package.

2] Class hides Imp. key data in the private section and uses these data in the public section , the user uses the public section without seeing the private section.

3] You create an object using a class(string from the string class).

4] class function members work on class data members.

5] when you want to construct an object, Destructors are used to release any resources allocated by the object.

8] A default constructor is a constructor which can be called with no arguments (either defined with an empty parameter list, or with default arguments provided for every parameter), prevent the compiler from generating a random one.

10] "this" pointer points to the object itself , "*this" is used when returning.
